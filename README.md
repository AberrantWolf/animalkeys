# AnimalKeys

Make it sound like animalese when you type with your keyboard. For fun.

Sooth yourself, or annoy those around you (or both!).

# Roadmap

- [ ] More sounds, especially for modified AnimalKeys
- [ ] Support for non-US keyboard layouts
- [ ] Hotkey to toggle the effect without stopping/restarting the program
- [ ] Customizable sounds (via a config file)
- [ ] Tray/taskbar/etc... icons so you can control some things while it's running (and without needing an open terminal or something)

# Copyright Stuff

Any sounds I may include in this repo will be some kind of creative commons license, probably. I will never attempt to acquire actual sounds from any games or software. If I'm very lucky, it may sound authentic, but they will always be sourced ethically, and licensed so you can share them around, worry-free.

# Privacy and Safety Notes

We like to have fun here, but I just want to bring up real quick some of the risks of running a program like this.

## Permission to Listen

This program requires reading your system input. At least on MacOS, probably on most Linux, and maybe even on Windows, you will have to enable some kind of elevated permissions for the program (or whatever program is running it).

On MacOS, that means enabling Accessibility for either AnimalKeys or your terminal program (if you run it from a terminal).

I'm sorry about it, but there's really no way around this, as what it does is inherently very not-private. We (or a library we use) could be logging your passwords or somthing.

## Spelling Out Passwords

I know it's really fun to have this working in the background, but like... for real, never _ever_ enter a password while this is running, and especially if you ever use this for streaming, _always_ stop the program if you need to ender a password.

This program has no idea you're about to put in a password, and will gleefully narrate each letter of your password as you type it.

Please be safe with your passwords. (T_T)
